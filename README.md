# 🚗 Second Hand Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the prices of second-hand cars using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various factors such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant features, the model aims to provide accurate price estimates for used cars in the market.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of second-hand cars using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing multiple factors such as car make, model, year, mileage, and more, the model provides accurate price estimates for pre-owned vehicles.

The key objective is to assist users and businesses in making informed decisions when buying or selling used cars by leveraging data-driven insights.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions, correlations, and key insights through visualization.
- **Model Selection**: Implementing multiple models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) and selecting the best-performing one.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model parameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy with metrics like Linear regression.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model as a web app for real-time price predictions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Dataset Source]. It includes comprehensive information on various attributes of second-hand cars, such as:

- **Make and Model**
- **Year of Manufacture**
- **Mileage**
- **Engine Size**
